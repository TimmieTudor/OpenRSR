# README
Rolling Sky fangame engine made with Unity3D

## What is this?
This is an open-source recreation of the game "Rolling Sky Remake". I started making this after being frustrated by 
the fact that Rolling Sky Remake (or RSR) was closed-source. I started developing this months before the RSR 1.0r update,
but I took a break from developing this project during the summer, because I was struggling with fixing bugs and adding the
new features. But I recently came back to this project after finding out that RSR 1.0r was discontinued.

## How to download?
You can download the game, but it's full of bugs and still unfinished, so I don't recommend downloading the game right now.

## How to build an APK for this unfinished game?
1. Clone this repository by running:
 ```git clone https://github.com/TimmieTudor/OpenRSR.git```
2. Download Unity 2023.1.18f1 with Android Build Tools if you haven't
3. Open the cloned repository in Unity 2023.1.18f1 (I switched to this very new version because I couldn't build the game for Android because of some errors)
4. Go to Build Settings, and make sure the platform is set to "Android"
5. Click "Build" and choose the file path where you want to save the APK.
6. Wait at least 2-3 minutes
7. And done! You can now send the built APK from your computer to your phone and install it!
